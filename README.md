# Feature Discovery

Feature Discovery is a machine learning library which aims to make it easier to find non-linear representations of 
your data that are beneficial for a specific classification task. Instead of manually having to look at a mountain of 
scree plots whilst trying to figure out how to engineer your feature space, Feature Discovery does the gruntwork for you 
and tries to come up with a list of promising transformations of the input features for you to look into
in more detail.   

# Background

A commonly known method for building machine learning models is the kernel method. The idea is to take a data set that
isn't linearly separable and make it separable by transforming the data into a higher dimensional space that is.
